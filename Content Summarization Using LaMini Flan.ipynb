It can help \\nus avoid potentially dangerous situations \\nand prepare for challenges. Stressful life \\nevents, such as taking a test, starting a new \\nschool, or speaking in front of a group can \\ntrigger normal forms of childhood anxiety \\nthat are helpful in preparing a child for the \\nchallenge ahead.

In fact, some \\nsuggest that anxiety disorders may affect 1 in 8 \\nchildren. The National Institute of Mental Health \\n(NIMH) estimates that 25.1% of adolescents \\nbetween the ages of 13 and 18 years will experience an anxiety disorder, and 5.9% will \\nexperience a severe anxiety disorder. Boys and \\ngirls are equally affected in childhood, and after \\npuberty, girls appear to be more commonly \\naffected than boys.\\nBoth genetics and the environment play a \\nrole in the anxiety disorders.

Children with anxiety disorders often \\nexperience a number of unexplained \\nphysical symptoms, such as \\nstomachaches, headaches, shortness \\nof breath, chest pain, worrying about \\nchoking, and gagging or vomiting. They \\noften worry about their overall health. \\nAnxious children may pay too much \\nattention to their body’s sensations \\nand mistakenly believe that these \\nsensations are symptoms of an illness. \\nAs a result, these children are likely to \\nappear as physically ill to their parents, \\nand to visit the school nurse and/or \\npediatrician more often, potentially leading to missed school days and even' metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\anxiety-parents-medication-guide.pdf', 'page': 4}\n",

Anxiety is a normal emotion that is critical  for our survival and functioning It can help  us avoid potentially dangerous situations  and prepare for challenges Stressful life  events, such as taking a test, starting a new  school, or speaking in front of a group can  trigger normal forms of childhood anxiety  that are helpful in preparing a child for the  challenge ahead That said, sometimes there  can be problems in expressing emotions that  can negatively affect day-to-day living Fear,can negatively affect day-to-day living Fear,  anxiety, sadness, and even our capacity to  enjoy ourselves can be a problem if these  emotions become extreme and impair one’s  capacity to function  How common are the anxiety  disorders, and who is affected? Anxiety disorders are common in children  and adolescents, and typically begin during  childhood and adolescence In fact, some  suggest that anxiety disorders may affect 1 in 8  children The National Institute of Mental Health  (NIMH) estimates that 251% of adolescents  between the ages of 13 and 18 years will experience an anxiety disorder, and 59% will  experience a severe anxiety disorder Boys and  girls are equally affected in childhood, and after  puberty, girls appear to be more commonly  affected than boys Both genetics and the environment play a  role in the anxiety disorders A genetic family  history of anxiety disorder puts a young person  at risk for developing an anxiety disorder In  addition, caregivers or relatives can respondaddition, caregivers or relatives can respond  to an anxious child in such a way as to make  the child’s anxiety even worse by unknowingly  supporting avoidance instead of engagement  and unintentionally reinforce fear and worry  instead of good coping What is the difference   between “normal” anxiety and   an anxiety disorder? Anxiety disorders are different from regular or  typical anxiety, just like depression is different  from everyday sadness or the way mania  (elevated and expansive mood) is different  from regular happiness and excitement Despite the different ways anxiety is  expressed among children from different  backgrounds and ethnicities, symptoms of  anxiety disorders differ from those of normal  anxiety in a number of important ways  1 Normal anxiety occurs at all time points in  life Yet, the anxiety disorders first affect  children before puberty and can begin or  get worse unexpectedly “out of the blue\"  2 Typical and developmentally appropriate2 Typical and developmentally appropriate  activities that most children enjoy are  not manageable for children with anxiety  disorders For a child with an anxiety disorder,  going to school, participating in sleepovers or  going to camp, making new friends at a party,Anxiety: Parents’ Medication Guide       5 “showing off,” and participating in new  and potentially rewarding experiences  (amusement parks) can be very anxiety  provoking As a matter of fact, the child’s  intense reaction is often surprising to  their caregivers, as the triggering cause  is often a routine and normal life event a  child of a certain age is expected to be  able to do  3 Children with anxiety disorders often  experience a number of unexplained  physical symptoms, such as  stomachaches, headaches, shortness  of breath, chest pain, worrying about  choking, and gagging or vomiting They  often worry about their overall health  Anxious children may pay too much  attention to their body’s sensations  and mistakenly believe that these  sensations are symptoms of an illness  As a result, these children are likely to  appear as physically ill to their parents,  and to visit the school nurse and/or  pediatrician more often, potentially leading to missed school days and evenunnecessary medical procedures  4 The persistence and consistency  of  the anxiety symptom picture over time  is key to diagnosing an anxiety disorder  That said, some anxious children can  experience a sudden worsening of  anxiety symptoms For example, an  8-year-old child who has been mildly  anxious as a younger child but enjoyed  school may now suffer from separation  anxiety and refuse to go to school  5 Children with anxiety tend to cope by  avoiding situations  that make them  anxious If the triggering experiences  are routine and necessary tasks  of growing up, the child’s everyday  functioning and home or school life  can be disrupted 6 Children with anxiety disorders can  also have normal anxiety  Trained  professionals, such as child and  adolescent psychiatrists, can recognize the symptom patterns of an anxiety  disorder, in part because the types  of symptoms are very similar among  children with anxiety disorders Parents and caregivers often get into aParents and caregivers often get into a  pattern of anticipating a child’s anxious  behaviors and, in an effort to relieve their  child’s distress, will help their child avoid  a potential anxiety trigger Unfortunately,  although the parents and caregivers  have the best intentions, their actions  may actually make the anxiety worse  and prevent the child from coping with  and adapting to typical and important  developmental tasks Avoidance,  meltdowns, or other behaviors that  continually keep a child from doing age- appropriate activities result in “functional”  impairment In addition, the physical  and emotional distress of anxiety is  “psychological” impairment When a child  with anxiety is experiencing functional   and psychological  impairment, they are  suffering from an anxiety disorder6       Anxiety: Parents’ Medication Guide The Anxiety Disorders Anxiety disorders are categorized into  different forms depending on the  symptoms children display (Table 1) Common Symptoms Across   All the Anxiety Disorders Although there are specific symptoms associated  with each of the anxiety disorders listed in  Table 1, there are common symptoms among  these disorders  • Hypervigilance—continuous scanning of the  environment for anything new and different  • Reactivity—whereas most children are  curious and interested in new things,  children with anxiety often feel threatened  by new or changing events or expectations  and react accordingly• Physical complaints—headaches, fear of  gagging, choking or vomiting, chest pain,  shortness of breathing, poor appetite,  stomachache, urgent bathroom trips,  increased sweating, muscle tension,  jitteriness, and difficulty falling asleep  • Avoidance—the most common and easiest  way for a child to cope with anxiety is toway for a child to cope with anxiety is to  avoid Instead of approaching a new situation  with curiosity as most children do, children  with anxiety disorders avoid their anxiety- triggering situations Avoidance of important  developmental tasks is a signal that the  child’s anxiety needs to be addressed • Behavioral issues—if the child cannot   avoid an anxiety-triggering situation,   he/she may demonstrate significant  behavioral issues, often described as  “meltdowns,” such as refusing to participate,  becoming oppositional, and having temper  tantrums Intense anxiety or meltdowns   are very challenging for most caregivers   and often leave them feeling powerless to  help their childAnxiety: Parents’ Medication Guide       7Table 1 Anxiety and Related Disorders Specific  Phobia• Irrational or extreme fearful reactions to an object or situation (eg, animals, heights, costume characters, and type of transportation) • Results in avoiding the objects or situations or in demonstrating distress when exposed to them in normal everyday life • Often the first sign of an anxiety disorder and can be associated with other anxiety disorders Separation  Anxiety• Specific worry that something bad will happen to them or to their caregivers if they are apart (eg, being in a different room in  the house from their caregivers, falling asleep alone in their bed, going to school in the morning, attending a sleepover at a close  friend’s house, or worry when their caregivers are not home or late coming home) • They may be described as being clingy or easily homesick Generalized  AnxietyGeneralized  Anxiety  Disorder• A variety of fears and worries about everyday life experiences (ie, they often anticipate disaster [eg, catastrophic thinking], worry  about their health issues and financial status, as well as their families’ health and finances, think about life and death, as well as  family and interpersonal relationship problems, and feel intense academic pressures) • They may be described as being worriers, tense, uptight, inflexible, and perfectionistic • May feel as if “something bad will always happen,” (if feelings of dread are extremely intense, may be misdiagnosed with depression) • May have problems falling asleep at night because of worry  • Sometimes have problems focusing and concentrating in school because they are preoccupied with worry (if significant, may be  misdiagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) Social  AnxietySocial  Anxiety  Disorder• Fear or worry about their functioning in social interactions (ie, they are extremely self-conscious and are afraid of being judged  or humiliated in a social situation or doing something silly or embarr assing, frightened at the thought of becoming the focus of  others’ attention) • May be limited to specific settings (ie, speaking in front of a group) or can be a global problem and affect them in 1:1 situations  (ie, ordering food in a restaurant and/or asking a safe stranger like a teacher a question or policeman for directions) • They are often considered to be shy, highly self-conscious, “slow to warm up,” hesitant to talk in social settings, “soft spoken,” and  reluctant to ask others’ questions, or may answer questions with short phrases and avoid making socially appropriate eye contact • Often have physical symptoms (ie, blushing, sweating, trembling or shaking, or feeling nauseated or sick to their stomach) when  they are confronting a social situation Panicthey are confronting a social situation Panic  Disorder• Experience panic attacks that are characterized by the sudden onset (within minutes) of intense fear that something bad is  happening or going to happen or fear of losing control • The panic attack usually peaks in 10 minutes and lasts for approximately 15 to 30 minutes, but the effects of having had a panic  attack can continue as the person worries about having another attack and what the attack could mean about their health, causing  them to avoid situations associated with the feeling of panic • Physical symptoms of a panic attack may include shortness of breath, chest pain, sense of irregular heartbeat, heart beating too  hard or too fast, increased breathing (hyperventilation) with tingling or numbness around the mouth and in the fingers, sweating, and  shaking; although they feel life threatening, they are not dangerous Obsessive  CompulsiveObsessive  Compulsive  Disorder• Characterized by obsessions, which are repeated and unwanted thoughts, urges, or mental images that cause anxiety, distress, and  are linked to compulsive behaviors • Compulsive rituals seem to relieve the anxiety from these thoughts in the short run, but the child often spends a substantial amount  of time obsessing or engaging in compulsions (more than 1 hour a day), which causes distress and daily dysfunction • Common obsessions include the following: fear of germs or contamination; unwanted, taboo thoughts about sex, religion, and  harm to self or others; unwanted aggressive thoughts; and the need for things to be balanced, symmetrical, or in perfect order • Common compulsions include the following: excessive grooming and hand washing; ordering and arranging things in a particular  and precise way; repeatedly checking on things such as whether the door is locked or whether the stove is off; and conductingmental rituals such as replacing a “bad thought” with a “good thought”8       Anxiety: Parents’ Medication Guide Assessment and Treatment It is important that the clinician evaluating a  child for an anxiety disorder is familiar with  the diagnosis, life course, and treatment  of anxiety disorders Given the potential for  the overlap of normal anxiety and anxiety  disorders, some pediatricians, primary care  doctors, school personnel, and mental health  professionals may not understand what the  anxiety disorders look like in children and may  not fully recognize anxiety disorders as an  important mental health problem  Child and adolescent psychiatrists, physicians  who specialize in the diagnosis and the  treatment of mental health conditions in  children and adolescents, are important  members of your child’s mental health care  team, as they offer families the advantages of  a medical education, the medical traditions of  professional ethics, and medical responsibility  for providing comprehensive care It is important to differentiate severe and ongoingIt is important to differentiate severe and ongoing  anxious reactions to significant life events  (ie, “normal” anxious reactions to extreme life  circumstance) from an anxiety disorder Anxiety  disorders require specific treatments and  anxious reactions to extreme life circumstances  are managed by providing children with safe,  secure, and predictable environments and even  treatment including psychological support In both  circumstances children having trouble handling  their day-to-day life activities should be seen by a  clinician for a complete assessment to see what  kind of treatment is needed Because many of the symptoms of anxiety  are experienced internally by a child (eg, fear  or worry), a caregiver may only recognize  the functional impairment that the child is  demonstrating; for example, difficulty falling  asleep, not going to school, anxiety around  performance situations, reluctance to engage  in social activities and make friends, strong  emotional reactions, and other avoidanceemotional reactions, and other avoidance  behavior A comprehensive evaluation by a  clinician will likely include completing rating scales and interviewing the parent and child about  the child’s internal symptoms and functional  impairment The clinician will work to understand  the child’s pattern of anxiety symptoms, level of  avoidance, and family readiness to engage in  treatment They will also determine whether the  child has other problems that might make the  treatment plan more challenging  The clinician will consider many factors in  deciding what treatment is needed for a child  with an anxiety disorder After the clinician has  evaluated a child, he/she should communicate  the results of the evaluation, specific treatment  recommendations and the reason behind  treatment recommendations Treatment  recommendations often include specific  recommendations about how the family can  best engage and support the child, essentially  becoming “coaches” who work with the child tobecoming “coaches” who work with the child to  “take on” their fears and worries While it is a big decision to enter a child into  treatment for an anxiety disorder, it is important  to understand that it is also a big decision to not  engage in treatment Clinical studies suggest  children with an anxiety disorder do not get  better with just support and longer-term studies  suggest anxiety, if not treated, is associated with  a number of poor life outcomes including the  risk for depression, substance misuse, suicidal  thoughts and behaviors, and difficulties with  adapting and coping Role of the Family in   Assessment and Treatment It is very important to have family involvement  in the assessment and treatment of anxiety  Clinicians know about anxiety disorders in  children, but they highly rely on the caregivers’  active engagement in assessment and  treatment to be able to do best by the child The  child’s caregivers are the clinician\\'s “eyes and  ears” Treatment is much more effective whenears” Treatment is much more effective when  parents and clinicians work together to reduce  the child\\'s anxietyRegardless of the  situation, when a  child is having trouble  handling their day- to-day life activities  because of anxiety,  they should be seen  by a clinician for a  complete assessment  to see if treatment is  recommendedAnxiety: Parents’ Medication Guide       9 The United States Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) oversees the  approval process to show that a  medication is safe and effective for a specific  condition (eg, generalized anxiety disorder)  After a medication has been approved by the  FDA, clinicians can use the medication for the  specific condition (ie, on-label prescribing)  or for any other condition where studies  have proven them effective or the physician  believes the medication can be effective and  safe (ie, off-label prescribing)  It is important to recognize that clinicians  who practice high quality “evidence-based”  medication treatment for children and adolescents with anxiety disorders will often  recommend and prescribe safe and effective  medications “off label” This is not a bad thing,  as the medications have been proven to be  effective and safe, even though they have not  gone through the FDA approval process For childhood anxiety disorders, only oneFor childhood anxiety disorders, only one  medication, duloxetine, has received FDA  approval and can be prescribed “on label”  for children 7 years of age and older with  generalized anxiety disorder However, a  number of other medications have been  proven to be safe and effective for treating   the childhood anxiety disorders but have not  gone through the FDA approval process  Medication as a   Tool for Treating Anxiety It is important   to recognize that  clinicians who practice  high quality “evidence- based” medication  treatment for children  and adolescents with  anxiety disorders often  will recommend and  prescribe safe and  effective medications  “off label”10       Anxiety: Parents’ Medication GuideWhat medications reduce  anxiety and its symptoms  consistently over time? Antidepressant medications represent  the foundation of medication treatment  for youth with anxiety disorders and OCD  Many of the medications that benefit  anxiety disorders and OCD were initially  recognized as medications for depression  and thus, called antidepressants The most  effective antidepressant medications,  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs), and selective norepinephrine  reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), increase the  effects of serotonin and norepinephrine,  chemical neurotransmitters in the human  body that help regulate anxiety, mood, and  social behavior  Antidepressant medications that have  proven to be effective for childhood  anxiety disorders that can be prescribed  \"on label\" include duloxetine (Cymbalta™)  and \"off label\" include sertraline (Zoloft™),  fluoxetine (Prozac™), fluvoxamine  (Luvox™), paroxetine (Paxil™), and  venlafaxine ER (Effexor XR™)venlafaxine ER (Effexor XR™) What is the goal of   treatment in a child or  teenager with anxiety? The goal of treatment for a child is always  remission (having few, if any symptoms)  of the anxiety disorder If remission is  not achieved with either antidepressant treatment or antidepressant treatment  combined with psychological treatment,  the clinician may consider a variety  of approaches, including medication  changes or adding other psychological  interventions It is important to keep  in mind that it is okay if a medication  change is suggested to reach the goal of  remission because a child may respond  better to the second medication Changing  the treatment in youth who do not respond  to initial medication treatment has been  shown to be beneficial What have studies on   antidepressant medication  use in children and  adolescents with anxiety  disorders shown?  Nearly a dozen studies have evaluated  antidepressant medications in children  and adolescents with generalized,and adolescents with generalized,  social, and separation anxiety disorders  (Table 2)  In nearly all studies, youth who  received antidepressant medication did  better than those who received placebo  (sugar pill) And those children who  received a combination of medication and  psychological treatment of anxiety did  best Likewise, in children with OCD, the  SSRIs have been studied and are effective  in reducing OCD symptoms Studies that  have compared SSRIs and psychotherapy  in youth with OCD have generally shown  that the combination of an antidepressant  The goal of treatment  for a child is always  remission (having few,  if any symptoms) of the  anxiety disorderAnxiety: Parents’ Medication Guide       11medication and psychotherapy is far   more effective than either psychotherapy  or medication alone How are medications chosen?  A clinician will consider several  factors in choosing whether to  prescribe a specific medication   for a child • Diagnosis • Age of the child • Medication effectiveness • Side effects • How quickly the medication works • Interactions with other  medications taken by the child • Way in which the medication is  taken (capsules, tablets, liquid) How long does   medication take to work? Often, improvement from antidepressant  medication begins in 2 to 4 weeks with  additional improvement over 8 to 12 weeks  Some children show improvement at low  doses of antidepressant medication very  early in treatment, however, clinicians  may increase the dose of the medication  to ensure the child has the best chance for remission In the clinical studies of  medication, the best treatment dose is often  identified in 8 to 12 weeks of treatment, withidentified in 8 to 12 weeks of treatment, with  symptoms continuously improving even  after that Studies suggest the beneficial  effects of SSRI treatment—regardless of  whether it is given with cognitive-behavioral  therapy (CBT)—reach maximum benefit at  6–9 months of treatment What medications are   used occasionally for intense  episodes of anxiety? Clinicians often use medications from  different classes to address a specific  experience of anxiety such as flying  on a plane, giving a speech, or other  performance activity Some of these  medications come from the class of  benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam  (Ativan™) and clonazepam (Klonipin™)  Benzodiazepines are generally used for  short term treatment When used for  long periods of time, some patients have  difficulty stopping the medication and  experience withdrawal symptoms Some clinicians will also use  antihistamines such as diphenhydramine  (Benadryl™) or hydroxyzine (Atarax™,  Vistaril™) to reduce anxiety for shortVistaril™) to reduce anxiety for short  periods of time Also, medications from  the class of beta-blockers such as  propranolol (Inderal™) have been used for  performance challenges such as public  speaking events In the clinical studies  of medication, the  best treatment dose is  often identified in 8 to  12 weeks of treatment,  with symptoms  continuously improving  even after that12       Anxiety: Parents’ Medication GuideTable 2 Medications that may be used to treat anxiety disorders in children and adolescents  Class Medication   (Brand name)Common dose range  (mg/day)Tablet size   (mg)Common side effects Serious side effects Uncommon, serious side effects SSRI Citalopram/escitalopram  (Celexa/LexaproTM)10/5–40/20 10/5, 20/10, 40 • Headache • Insomnia • Diarrhea • Decreased appetite • Hyperactivity/restlessness • Vomiting • Increased anger/irritability • Sexual dysfunction • Muscle pain • Weight loss/gain• Boxed warning—suicidal thinking and  behavior in children, adolescents, and  young adults • Potential for abnormal   heart rhythm • Mania• Serotonin syndrome • Bleeding problems Fluvoxamine (LuvoxTM,   Luvox CRTM)100–300 25, 50, 100, 150 Sertraline (ZoloftTM) 25–200 25, 50, 100 Fluoxetine   (ProzacTM, SarafemTM)10–60 10, 20, 40, 60 Paroxetine (PaxilTM, PexevaTM)10–50 10, 20, 40 SNRI Noradrenergic agentVenlafaxine ER (EffexorTM) 375–225 375, 75, 150, 225 • Sleepiness • Insomnia• Insomnia • Restlessness • Sexual dysfunction • Headache • Dry mouth • Increased anger/irritability • Increased blood pressure • Increased heart rate • Muscle pain • Weight loss/gain• Boxed warning—suicidal thinking and  behavior in children, adolescents, and  young adults  • Mania• Serotonin syndrome • Bleeding problems Duloxetine (CymbaltaTM) 30–120 20, 30, 40, 60 Atomoxetine (StratteraTM) 10–100 10, 18, 25, 40, 60, 80, 100 Tricyclic antidepressant Clomipramine (AnafranilTM) 75–250 25, 50, 75 • Sleepiness • Dry mouth • Weight gain• Boxed warning–suicidal thinking and  behavior in children, adolescents, and  young adults • Heart rhythm problems;  electrocardiogram and   blood levels • ManiaSerotonin syndrome Imipramine   (TrofanilTM, Trofranil-PMTM)10, 25, 50 Benzodiazepine Alprazolam (XanaxTM,  Alprazolam IntensolTM)05–15 025, 05, 1, 2 • Drowsiness • Clumsiness • Dry mouth • Dizziness • Abdominal pain• Possible dependence • Withdrawal symptoms when used at high• Withdrawal symptoms when used at high  doses, especially when administered over  long periods Decreasing the dose gradually  is a common strategy to decrease the risk  of withdrawal symptoms  • Disinhibition • Memory impairment • Worsening depressionRespiratory depression (possible  at high doses and when  combined with other central  nervous system depressants)Clonazepam (KlonopinTM) 05–3 05, 1, 2 Lorazepam (AtivanTM,  Lorazepam IntensolTM)1–2 1, 2  Atypical anxiolytic Buspirone (BusparTM) 15–60 5, 10, 15, 30 • Dizziness • Lightheadedness • Tiredness Antihistamine Diphenhydramine  (BenadrylTM, BanophenTM,  DiphenhistTM)125–50 25, 50 • Sleepiness • Dry mouth • Decreased sweating• Abnormal heart rhythms • Agitation • Difficulty completely emptying the bladder • Harm to certain types of blood cells • SeizuresDoxylamine   (UnisomTM, WalSomTM)125–50 25, 50 Hydroxyzine (AtaraxTM) 25–50 10, 25, 50 Adapted from Wilens, Hammerness Straight Talk about Psychiatric Medications in Kids (Guilford Press, 2016)Anxiety: Parents’ Medication Guide       13What medications are used   for occasional sleep problems   in youth with anxiety? Sleep is often a significant problem in  youth with anxiety Treatment of the anxiety  disorder with antidepressants and/or  CBT is often beneficial in reducing anxiety  and restoring normal sleep patterns If  the child’s anxiety is under very good  control and falling asleep is still a problem,  behavioral approaches should be tried next  If behavioral approaches are not successful  there are different medications that help  children with anxiety sleep better Clinicians  often pick among medications such as  melatonin, antihistamines, antidepressants  that sedate like mirtazapine, and even  some medications specifically marketed  for insomnia in adults such as zolpidem  (Ambien™) and zaleplon (Sonata™) While  medicines used in adults for insomnia may  be useful in children, they have not been  studied extensively in children  How is the medication   dose selected and changed?How is the medication   dose selected and changed? For the antidepressant medications,  physicians select an initial dose based on  studies that have evaluated the medication  in children and adolescents In general,  children with anxiety are started on a low  dose of medication, with incremental  increases to reach the appropriate dose  that offers the best chance for remission  with minimal, if any side effects Over the  course of treatment, the caregiver and  child will meet with the clinician regarding  how the anxiety symptoms have changed  and whether there are side effects Some  clinicians adjust doses more quickly (with  more frequent check-in visits), and others  may prefer a more gradual approach  “Going low and slow” is okay; however, it is  important to understand that starting too  low and going too slow may unnecessarily  prolong a child’s suffering The common  dose ranges for medications that are used  to treat children with anxiety are shown   in Table 2  How are side effects managed?in Table 2  How are side effects managed? Antidepressants such as SSRIs and  SNRIs can have various side effects,  as shown in Table 2 It is important to  discuss medication side effects with your child’s physician Everyone worries about  side effects but people and children with  anxiety disorders are likely to worry more  than others do The presence of side  effects is an important part of decision  making for dose adjustments Sometimes  it is difficult to tell if the child is having a  side effect or if it is the anxiety that is still  impacting the child (eg stomachache)  Common side effects, which occur in  approximately 10–20% of patients, include  headaches, difficulty sleeping, appetite  changes, abdominal pain, and diarrhea  Possible side effects, which may occur in 5%  of patients, include weight gain, muscle pain,  and common cold symptoms Rare side  effects, which occur much less frequently,  include seizures, deliberate self-harm,  abnormal heart rhythms, and mania Suicidalabnormal heart rhythms, and mania Suicidal  thinking and behavior is discussed in the box  to the left It is important to know that this  risk has not been shown in most studies of  SSRIs in youth with anxiety disorders Perhaps of most concern to parents  is whether the medication will change  a child’s behavior or personality in an  unwanted way In general, when SSRIs  and SNRIs work well they reduce the  child’s anxiety greatly, and allow the child  to function as they would if they were not  anxious It is important to know that the  medications reduce anxiety, but don’t solve  all the problems a child might have  Lastly, across all the SSRI and SNRI  studies there is a common pattern of  side effects that we call “activation  syndrome”—an excessive and  uncomfortable restlessness that occurs  early in treatment or soon after a dose  change The activation may cause the  child to be more irritable, impulsive, and  overall more difficult to manage Reducing  the dose of medication or discontinuing itthe dose of medication or discontinuing it  is the best management strategy until the  activation symptoms go away Since the  activation symptoms most often occur  early in treatment and at lower doses,  it may be difficult to get a child to a full  treatment dose if the medication seems to  cause activation The usual strategy for managing  side effects is to reduce the dose or  discontinue the medication However,  adjusting the dose to minimize the side What is the FDA warning? The FDA added a “boxed  warning” to all antidepressant  medications to alert  prescribing physicians and  patients that special care  should be taken when using  antidepressant medications  in children, adolescents, and  young adults The warning  states that antidepressant  medications are “associated  with an increased risk of  suicidal thinking and/or  behavior in a small proportion  of children and adolescents,  especially during the early  phases of treatment” Such  “adverse events” (mostly  suicidal thoughts) were“adverse events” (mostly  suicidal thoughts) were  reported by approximately 4%  of all children and adolescents  taking medication compared  with 2% of those taking a  placebo More recent and  larger studies suggest that the  associated risk is even less It  is important to understand that  it is not known why there is a  small but somewhat greater  risk for suicidal thoughts or  behavior on medication than  on placebo14       Anxiety: Parents’ Medication Guideeffects may result in losing some of  the benefit of the medication It can be  a delicate balance that a caregiver and  the clinician have to manage together  If the clinician has to reduce the dose  of the medication to reduce side effects  and symptoms return, the clinician will  review the treatment options with the  caregiver so the child can have his/her  best outcome Switching medication is  something that is commonly done when  the first medication does not work or  there are side effects How do I know the   medication is working?  The question of whether treatment— medication, psychological treatment, or  the combination of the two—is working  is best answered by observing whether  a child’s anxiety decreases in frequency  and severity and the child appears overall  more comfortable and able to do things  Parents, caregivers, and clinicians may  also answer this question by examining improvements in specific targetsymptoms, such as worrying excessively  In general, for kids with anxiety disorders,  parents and caregivers will be able  to observe that the child is able to do  things now that they could not do before  such as falling asleep quickly, spending  the night at a friend’s house, going to  a party, attending school and camp,  being around groups of people, going to  malls or restaurants, etc Anxiety-related  physical symptoms (eg, headaches,  stomachaches, difficulty swallowing, etc)  will decrease or stop altogether  How long should   medication be continued? As caregivers and the child consider  when to stop antidepressant treatment,  it is important to recall that the end  goal of treatment is having few if any  symptoms The child has the best chance  of discontinuing treatment if they have  experienced remission and functional  recovery Any discussion regarding ifAnxiety: Parents’ Medication Guide       15 and when to discontinue treatment  should only happen then Children with  ongoing symptoms of anxiety and  associated impairment may not be  the best candidates for stopping their  medication Increasing their medication  or psychological treatment to achieve  remission before considering stopping  treatment may be best While a specific timeframe is not known,  some experts recommend discontinuing  medication 6–12 months after remission  has been achieved A child who has  successfully worked with his/her family  in psychotherapy along with medication  treatment or a child with a faster  response to treatment (more likely with  antidepressant plus psychotherapy)  might be ready to discontinue medication  treatment more quickly It is important  to keep in mind that there is no evidence  suggesting that long-term antidepressant  treatment is unsafe when medication is  overall well-tolerated A risk of discontinuing medication is  the chance that anxiety symptomsthe chance that anxiety symptoms  will return even in children who have  recovered Families should only consider  stopping antidepressant treatment during  periods of low stress and specifically  not when the child might be expected to  be most anxious For example, stopping  medication before school starts in the  fall in a child with separation anxiety who  struggled to go to school is probably not  a good idea Also, for some children with  anxiety, seemingly low stress periods  like family vacations or holidays may  seem like a good time to stop medication  but may actually be stressful and the  resulting anxiety be mistakenly blamed on  the medication discontinuation  If a child has successfully come   off medication, it can be useful to   monitor the child off medication to   ensure that subtle anxiety symptoms   do not return, and the child maintains  their functional recovery16       Anxiety: Parents’ Medication Guide Psychosocial   Treatments for Anxiety  The clinician who assesses  the child may recommend a  specific psychological treatment  such as cognitive-behavioral therapy  (CBT), or a combination of CBT and  medication, which are the evidence- based treatments for the childhood- onset anxiety disorders—specifically,  separation, generalized and social  anxiety disorders, and OCD  The evidence-based psychological  treatment (CBT) for the anxiety  disorders and OCD begins with  educating the child and family about  the nature of the anxiety symptoms  and how the symptoms may worsen  over time, if not addressed effectively  For example, a child who is anxious,  and copes by avoiding, may feel better  in the short term but avoiding actually  reinforces anxiety in the long term  After the child and family understand  this important dynamic, the clinician should engage the child in a process  called “exposure and response  prevention” Exposure and responseprevention” Exposure and response  prevention treatment teaches the  child two important things: 1) the fear  or worry is not necessary for normal  developmental tasks; and 2) with time,  the fear or worry will go away or be  better tolerated, and the child will learn  how to cope without avoiding  Although psychotherapy can be a  very effective form of treatment for  some children with anxiety disorders,  this guide focuses on medication  treatments Other resources that  discuss CBT in more detail are available  Also, psychotherapy may be used in  combination with medication Children  who receive the combination   of psychotherapy plus medication   have fewer anxiety symptoms than  children who receive medication only   or psychotherapy only  The evidence- based psychological  treatment (CBT) for  the anxiety disorders  and OCD begins with  educating the child  and family about the  nature of the anxiety  symptoms and how the  symptoms may worsen  over timeAnxiety: Parents’ Medication Guide       17 • American Academy of Child &   Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP)   https://wwwaacaporg/AACAP/Families_and_ Youth/Resource_Centers/Anxiety_Disorder_ Resource_Center/Homeaspx • Anxiety and Depression   Association of America   https://adaaorg • Centers for Disease Control   and Prevention (CDC)   https://wwwcdcgov/childrensmentalhealth/ depressionhtml • National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)   https://wwwnamiorg/Find-Support/Family- Members-and-Caregivers • National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)   https://wwwnimhnihgov/health/topics/ anxiety-disorders/indexshtml • https://wwwnimhnihgov/health/publications/ anxiety-disorders-listingshtmlResources18       Anxiety: Parents’ Medication Guide Medication Tracking Form Use this form to track your child’s medication history Bring this form to appointments with your provider   and update changes in medications, doses, side effects and results Date Medication Dose Side Effects Reason for keeping/stoppingAuthor Disclosures KAREEM GHALIB, MD Assistant Clinical Professor,   Department of Psychiatry Columbia University Medical Center No disclosures to report KIMBERL Y A GORDON-ACHEBE, MD Medical Director Hope Health Systems, Inc Leadership Roles: Caucus of Black  Psychiatrists;

    "sample_text = '''Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a young girl named Amelia. Amelia lived in a small cottage at the edge of a dense forest with her mother, father, and younger brother, Max. The forest was a magical place, filled with all sorts of creatures, both friendly and fearsome. Amelia and Max loved to explore the forest, and they had many adventures there.\n",
    "\n",
    "One day, while Amelia and Max were exploring a particularly dense part of the forest, they stumbled upon a hidden cave. The cave was tucked away behind a thicket of bushes and was almost invisible unless you knew where to look. Amelia and Max were curious and decided to venture inside.\n",
    "a\n",
    "The inside of the cave was dark and damp, but Amelia and Max were not afraid. They had brought a lantern with them, and Amelia lit it as they ventured further into the cave. As they walked deeper into the cave, they noticed strange markings on the walls. They were unlike anything they had ever seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amelia and Max continued to explore the cave, and as they ventured deeper, they came across a large chamber. In the center of the chamber was a pedestal with a small, glowing object resting on it. Amelia approached the pedestal and picked up the object. It was a small, round stone that emitted a soft, warm light.\n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as Amelia picked up the stone, the ground began to tremble, and the walls of the cave started to shake. Amelia and Max were frightened and ran out of the cave as fast as they could. When they reached the entrance of the cave, they turned around and saw that the cave had collapsed behind them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amelia and Max were relieved to have escaped the cave, but they were also curious about the stone Amelia had found. They decided to take it home with them and show it to their parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "When they arrived home, their parents were surprised to see them with the stone. Amelia and Max explained how they had found it in the cave and how the cave had collapsed after they took the stone. Their parents were worried but also intrigued by the stone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amelia's father, a scholar and historian, examined the stone carefully. He recognized the markings on the stone as an ancient language that had long been forgotten. He believed that the stone was a key to unlocking a hidden treasure that was said to be buried deep within the forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Excited by this discovery, Amelia and Max decided to go on a quest to find the hidden treasure. Their parents were worried about the dangers they might encounter along the way, but they knew that Amelia and Max were resourceful and capable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next morning, Amelia and Max set out on their adventure. They packed a bag with food, water, and other supplies, and headed into the forest. They followed a map that their father had given them, which he believed would lead them to the hidden treasure.\n",
    "\n",
    "As they ventured deeper into the forest, Amelia and Max encountered all sorts of creatures, some friendly and some not so friendly. They came across a river that was too wide to cross, so they built a raft and sailed across. They climbed steep hills, crossed narrow bridges, and navigated through dense thickets.\n",
    "\n",
    "After several days of traveling, Amelia and Max arrived at the location marked on the map. It was a small clearing in the middle of the forest, surrounded by tall trees. In the center of the clearing was a large rock with a hole in the center.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amelia and Max approached the rock and examined the hole. It was just large enough for the stone that Amelia had found in the cave. Amelia placed the stone into the hole, and as she did so, the ground began to tremble again.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, however, the trembling did not stop. The ground cracked open, and a hidden staircase appeared. Amelia and Max were excited and a little bit nervous as they descended the staircase.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the bottom of the staircase was a large chamber, similar to the one they had found in the cave. In the center of the chamber was a pedestal with a chest resting on it. Amelia and Max approached the chest and opened it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the chest was a collection of gold coins, jewels, and other valuable items. Amelia and Max were thrilled to have found the hidden treasure. They carefully packed the treasure into their bags and began the journey home.\n",
    "\n",
    "When they arrived home, their parents were relieved to see them safe and sound. Amelia and Max showed them the treasure they had found, and their parents were amazed. They were proud of their children for their bravery and resourcefulness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amelia and Max were heroes in their village, and the story of their adventure became legendary. They had found the hidden treasure and returned home safely, proving that with courage and determination, anything is possible.'''"
